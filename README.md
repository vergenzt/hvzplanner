# Humans vs Zombies Path Planner

Note: Dependency stuff is not yet cleaned up. The only dependency not in the lib folder is a version of [vergenzt/robotutils](https://github.com/vergenzt/robotutils/tree/73166318f62f4e18276824ccc1dec80774adca08) with a few random fixes. I hope to reverse those changes soon after I determine how to fix this source code first.

To set up in Eclipse, once this repo is checked out, check out vergenzt/robotutils at the above-linked commit, and add it as a project dependency, in addition to the `jar`s in `lib/`.
